# Sprout Demo

## Getting Started

```
git clone git@github.com:gabeodess/sprout-demo.git
cd sprout-demo
npm i
DEBUG=sprout:* npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

## Room for Improvement

 - Impelement Vue's component based architecture
 - Add assets for Airline icons
 - Use Vue's production package instead of their development package on deployment
 - Add filtering options instead of just showing the first 10 results
 - Add expansion option to view segments of a trip
 - Solve CORS restrictions so we don't have to use a proxy API
